# Experiment 14: Optimized Production Configuration
# Based on analysis of all experiments - this combines the best settings found.
#
# Key findings applied:
# 1. MLX backend outperforms PyTorch by ~18%
# 2. Length-aware batching reduces latency by ~25%
# 3. Single model instance (no pool) is most stable on MPS
# 4. Concurrency=1 avoids MPS instability issues
# 5. Batch size 32-96 is the sweet spot for throughput/latency balance

# Expected results (based on prior experiments):
# batch=32: ~700 p/s, ~46ms latency  (best latency)
# batch=48: ~750 p/s, ~60ms latency  (good balance)
# batch=64: ~780 p/s, ~80ms latency
# batch=96: ~800 p/s, ~120ms latency (best throughput)
