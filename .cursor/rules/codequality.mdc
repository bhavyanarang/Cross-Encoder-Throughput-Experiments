Run the experiments for any changes in the flow (even small subset is fine but we want to make sure the dashboard metrics and experiments don't break)

Also use virtualenv to install any dependencies and run the code

Screenshots should be in images and not html

Code should be inside /src folder always, bash scripts in scripts

Follow best practices and DRY principle, dataclasses and models should be in separate files and the main classes should call others and be orchestrator and should not contain any other logical code.

No global variables
