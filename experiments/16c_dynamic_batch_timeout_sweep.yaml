# Experiment 16c: Dynamic Batching - Timeout Sensitivity Analysis
# Test different timeout values to find optimal configuration
#
# Purpose: The timeout_ms parameter controls how long the scheduler waits
# to collect requests before processing a batch. Too high = latency overhead,
# too low = may not aggregate enough requests to benefit from batching.
#
# HYPOTHESIS: Lower timeouts should reduce overhead but may not aggregate
# enough requests under low load. Higher timeouts help under bursty load
# but add unnecessary latency under sustained load.
