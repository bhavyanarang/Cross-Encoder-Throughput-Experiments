# Experiment 13: Multi-Model Pool - Sweep instance counts
# Note: This requires special handling as it uses model_pool instead of model
# We'll create separate configs for 2x, 3x, 4x instances
name: "13_multi_model_sweep"
description: "Multi-model pool with 2, 3, and 4 instances"

# This experiment uses model_pool which doesn't support lists directly
# We'll keep individual files for now or handle it specially
# For now, keeping as reference - actual implementation may need custom handling
