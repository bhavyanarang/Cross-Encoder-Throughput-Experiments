# Experiment 11: Quantization Comparison - Sweep quantization modes
name: "11_quantization_sweep"
description: "Compare FP32, FP16, and INT8 quantization on MPS backend"
# Note: quantization_mode list will be expanded, and each config will need
# different settings (quantized: true for int8, fp16: true/false for fp16/fp32)
# The sweep handler should handle this, but if not, we may need custom logic

model:
  backend: "mps"
  device: "mps"
  quantized: false  # Will be set to true for int8 in sweep handler
  quantization_mode: ["fp32", "fp16", "int8"]
  mps:
    fp16: false  # Will be overridden: false for fp32, true for fp16, N/A for int8

batching:
  enabled: false

experiment:
  batch_sizes: [96]
  concurrency_levels: [1]
